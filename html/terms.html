            <div style="color:black;text-align:justify;font-size:1.25em;">WhaleVault is a better, safer cross-chain way to access all your graphene accounts from the browser. 
                    <br><br>First off, you'll need a "Master Password", required 
                    to access any of your connected graphene accounts.<br/><br/>
                    <i>Warning:</i> WhaleVault is not meant to replace <b>permanent</b> out-of-browser cold storage such as the <b>KeePass Password Safe</b> (<a href="https://keepass.info">keepass.info</a>).

                WhaleVault is a chrome extension designed for managing multiple graphene blockchain accounts, and allows websites to authenticate identify and sign 
                transactions with your explicit permission, and without ever having to directly expose your private keys to any particular website directly. 
                Any materials such as tutorials, code, written documentation and other content related to WhaleVault also falls under this agreement.
                <br><br>
                Users are always in control of their own digital assets (such as accounts, keypairs, and tokens) via popup boxes enabling the user to Accept or Deny 
                each transaction, information request, and additional requests.  Certain transactions can also be white-listed on a site-by-site basis.
                <br><br>

                THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

                SOFTWARE.

                When setting up WhaleVault, you are responsible for keeping your own account secrets, which may be a twelve-word seed phrase, a backup file, passwords, 
                keypairs, or other locally stored secret information. WhaleVault encrypts this information locally with a strong seed derived from the password you provide, 
                and is never transmitted over the internet in any form whatsoever.
                
                You should never use the same password for WhaleVault that you have already used elsewhere; (b) keep your secret information and password confidential, 
                and do not share them with anyone else.  Again, WhaleVault is provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind, and cannot and will not be liable for any 
                loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with these directives.  By using WhaleVault, you recognize yourself as the sole legal owner of your 
                own secrets, keys, passwords, seed phrases, and other private data.
